  <h2>Introducing the Activity.</h2>
<ol>

  <!--
    TheMadmin Strikes!!! Show these videos to learners first. It helps them build a concept of what the finished product could be. 
    TheMadmin does not like to talk much before playing the videos. Just let the learners experience the video. Tell them about the details after.
    Deviate from this approach if you dare! 
-->

  <li>Watch <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/02/success/equal-pay-day-women-paid-less-men/index.html">CNN Report</a> on Gender Wage Gap.</li>
<li>Watch Dr. Jay Finkelman's <a href="https://www.foxla.com/news/local-news/how-to-overcome-a-toxic-workplace">interview in FoxLA Channel 11's story</a> on toxic leadership.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Deliverables.</h2>
<p>Each learner must submit their own copy of their group&rsquo;s documentation to Canvas. Submit a single file containing supported statements and best practices. Students will submit their verbal responses to prop camera and mock-production team during class.</p>
<h2>Grading.</h2>
<p>Points for today&rsquo;s exercise will be provided as a composite score worth as much as the final exam.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>In-class Exercise Instructions</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">For this scenario, suppose your employer recently saw Dr. Finkelman's interview. They spoke with an old friend, who is a producer at CNN, about having some employees help produce a similar video-journalism piece. This piece will be written by interns, who will also appear in the video as interviewees.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">The producer at CNN loved the idea your boss presented. The producer recently created a piece that is similar to the Wage Gap video (link above).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Benefit to Learners.</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">This exercise is an opportunity to build skills needed to produce an expert video segment with a small group of similar experts. Within organizations, this is a valuable form of leadership for I-Os in talent development or training departments. Outside of organizations, this type of expertise can result in high-quality, simple-to-produce videos that get your name out there as an industrial-organizational psychology professional (e.g., marketing your consulting services via YouTube).&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Benefit to Organizations.</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">Organizations generally look for ways to add educational content to their learning management systems (LMS) for talent development and training purposes. Cameras and LMS servers are easily obtained by employees. For example, a common method of video production is asking a coworker to hold a smartphone while the employee talks through the steps of completing an actual job task. The content can be uploaded to the company server in minutes for any other employees to view. This activity can be difficult at first but can be mastered with practice.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">This activity helps learners gain comfort with production skills, which will hopefully translate into producing more videos. The videos add value to the organization by sharing knowledge and skills in a timely and repeatable way. The exact outcomes of training depend on the context of the organization. As a rule of thumb, having more expert resources made by experts within the organization is generally considered preferable to having less educatinal resources to offer employees. For organizations who are looking to add to their video libraries, adding an I-O to the team who comes with production skills can be a valuable asset.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Topic.</strong></span> Your boss wants CNN to do a follow-up story about how HR managers follow steps to treat workers fairly. <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The producers want you to talk about selection procedures</span></em>. You are asked to contribute written content and appear in the video as a subject-matter expert (SME or "smee").***</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Form Groups</strong>.</span>You will form groups of 4-5 peers.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Written Content.</strong></span> Your boss promised the producers that your team will provide a document containing <em>Supported Statements</em> and <em>Best Practices</em>, as described below. For the mock-video deliverable, each team member must present one Supported Statement and one Best Practice.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;">1. <em><strong>Supported Statements.</strong></em> Look through the textbook to find statements about this topic of interest, which are supported by a research study. Statements in the textbook are a secondary source. The peer-reviewed article referenced by the passage in a textbook is a primary source. For each supported statement, provide a secondary and primary source. Remember that your video will be seen by wide audiences and there may voices of dissent.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;"><strong>Primary/Secondary Sources</strong>: An excerpt from employment law (e.g., Civil Rights Act of 1964) is a primary source. A summary of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as prepared by an organization such as EEOC, is a secondary source.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;"><em><strong>Example.</strong> Find a section where the textbook references a research study relating to fair selection procedures. Cite the page number (secondary source). Find the article it references using Google Scholar or a library article search. Provide an APA-formatted citation to the article cited in that passage (primary source). </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;">2. <em><strong>Best Practices.</strong></em> Looking at your supported statements, do these seem to fit into a best practice for HR managers? Your deliverable should be 3-4 sentences clearly stating best practices for an HR manager who might have an unfair selection process at their place of employment. Work through the questions below with your group. Write keywords from group answers on a whiteboard.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;"><em>(HINT: The areas that seem especially important, or seem to be voiced by multiple group members, relate to best practices.)</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;">a. In general, how do large organizations select employees to be hired, promoted, etc?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;">b. How do organizations use selection responsibly?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;">c. What are some ways selection can lead to adverse impact? (Describe protected classes, selection based on criteria not found on job analysis).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;">d. What laws relate to adverse impact when selecting employees?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;">e. How can an HR manager know if their organization selects employees unfairly? (Hint: Describe four-fifths rule and moderated multiple regression models.)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;">f. What steps can a manager take to make sure their selection system is fair?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;">g. How can an applicant know if they were unfairly excluded from a work opportunity? Are there indicators to watch for?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;">h. What steps can an applicant take if they believe they were adversely impacted by a selection procedure?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;">i. Generally, what is a job analysis? Recommend at least one resource where HR managers can find examples of job analyses. Is this something the public can view as well?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;">j. What is a cutoff score? How does a manager use a cutoff as an employment test?&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;">k. Describe a method for cut scores.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 80px;">3. <strong>On-set Preparation</strong>. Each member of the group will be expected to say the following into the prop camera:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;">a. Recite one supported statement per group member. Provide support from the textbook and a primary source. You can usually boil it down to 2-3 sentences. Practice to make sure you know your line(s).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 120px;">b. Recite one best practice with ad-lib. The ad-lib will be a few sentences of ad-lib describing how/why an HR manager could find themselves in such a situation and what steps they can take to remedy it. The producer may ask you a few questions to get multiple takes. This gives the editors more options when finalizing the story. The producer may also ask you what the HR manager should NOT do in a certain situation.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">***Note that our activity will involve a camera as a prop. It will not contain a memory cartridge and there will be no recording made at all during our class. By department policy, students are never to appear on any filming that occurs during onground sessions.</p>

<!--
  The Madmin strikes again!!! 
  At this point, invite a second group of learners to participate in the production crew. Have each group member hold a prop (or imaginary) clapboard, boom mic, camera, lights, interview questions, make-up or styling (watch for crazy hair or bent collars on shirts), crowd control for others in the room, etc.

  In this activity, the camera is a prop with no memory card. This is important if the setting prohibits filming of learners.
